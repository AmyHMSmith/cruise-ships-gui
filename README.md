This cruise ships project has a Ship object, Port object and Itineray object.

Ship object 
- imports from Itinerary an array of ports to dock at
- the currentPort = first port in the itinerary array
- using the addShip() and removeShip() from Port, the dock() method addShip() into the dockedShips array, and the setSai() method removeShip() from the array. I have added a function code to select and remove a specified ship from the array.
